QGM -> Logical plan
====================

A logical plan has LOPs: Scan, Join, Agg, etc.

Each LOP has:
    input: Vec<NodeId>  // expression ids
    output: Vec<NodeId> // expression ids
    input_lops


Collect all column references for each QUN. These will turn into baseline column projections.

Classify predicates:
- Local: Only references columns from a single QUN
- Equi-join: column-expr-1 = column-expr-2 where column-exprs have disjoint QUNs
- Other

=========================

Join enumeration:

If we have just 1, we're done.

If we have 2 tables:

If 2+ tables, iterate over all pairs that have equi-join edges.
Then add each remaining table that has a join edge to subgraph.
If multiple tables, pick one.

For each table added to the mix:
    Inputs: Add projected columns as inputs.
    Outputs: Add any select-list columns + Add any fully-bound pred-expressions
