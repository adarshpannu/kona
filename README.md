yet another relational data engine: a passion project using Rust

This is a passion project as I learn how to program in Rust. I
have no specific end goal in mind except to write some Rust code
and have fun doing so. But while I'm at it, I figured I might as
well build something meaningful.

So here is yarde: a distributed relational data engine with
columnar underpinnings. Lots of such engines already exist. Most
of them are very good. And that's alright. I'm not trying to
compete with anything.

As of May 2023, this is still half-baked code. Call it work in
progress. It can parse and (almost) compile trivial SQL queries
but cannot run anything yet. Hopefully that will change over
time.
